# Covid Data Analysis (SQL Data Exploration)
## Objective
This Project aims to explore and visualize Data about the Covid-19 Pandemic to uncover 
certain insights from the start and identify areas or patterns to dig into more.
## Data Source
The data is publicly available on the following [website](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).  
It is important to note that this data source is constantly updated. However, as at the
time this project was carried out, the data was last updated on the 12th December, 2022.
Hence, the insights generated from the exploration of this data is based on Covid-19 data 
from the 1st of January, 2020 till 12th December, 2022.
## Data Processing
The data was processed and prepared for analysis (in SQL) using MS-Excel. Irrelevant columns
were removed, the data was confirmed to be duplicates-free and the dataset was seperated into 
two Tables (titled CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations) to ensure disctinction and clarity of 
purpose while analyzing the data. The two tables were later joined in SQL during analysis.
